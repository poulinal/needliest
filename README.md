Code to control a needle valve for pressure control via a PID controller. Currently a basic PID controller is implemented in MATLAB and simulated in Simscape in a similar environment to its use in an LRE rocket. Further improvements include auto-tuning functionality, migrating the code to CPP, integrating with control to the motor on the PID controller, and potential modifications to the basic PID functions (for better tuning or responses).
